# MakingTheHikaru26FreqListInto3
A simple script I written as a a way to bypass the free-user restriction for making decks from text files (max 10k). This is made specifically to split the Hikaru 26k freq list, to three decks of 10k-10k-6k respectively. Written in such a way that the output file contains only the term itself since the order they appear in already indicates freq.
